                            work, and the lack of flexibility, often lead to unemployment among people

                            But equally important is to know what constitutes the right work for employees.
                            Often people choose jobs in a haste and resign a few months after joining the
                            company. Some may do it intentionally, but most would do it because of a mismatch
                            between their interests and job requirements. This is where we make a difference!
